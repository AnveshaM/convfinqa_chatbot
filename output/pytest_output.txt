Answer the question based on the above context: what was, then, in millions, the total tax of benefit realized from option exercises under all incentive plans for both years, 2013 and 2014 combined?

Response:  The text does not provide the total tax benefit in millions realized from option exercises under all incentive plans for both years, 2013 and 2014 combined. It only mentions that the total fair value of incentive/performance unit shares and restricted stock/units awarded vested during 2013 and 2012 was approximately $63 million and $55 million, respectively. The text also mentions that the weighted-average grant date fair value of incentive/performance unit awards and restricted stock/unit awards granted in 2014, 2013, and 2012 was $80.79, $64.77, and $60.68 per share, respectively. However, it does not provide the tax benefit realized from those awards for each year.

Expected Response: 64
Actual Response:  The text does not provide the total tax benefit in millions realized from option exercises under all incentive plans for both years, 2013 and 2014 combined. It only mentions that the total fair value of incentive/performance unit shares and restricted stock/units awarded vested during 2013 and 2012 was approximately $63 million and $55 million, respectively. The text also mentions that the weighted-average grant date fair value of incentive/performance unit awards and restricted stock/unit awards granted in 2014, 2013, and 2012 was $80.79, $64.77, and $60.68 per share, respectively. However, it does not provide the tax benefit realized from those awards for each year.

(Answer with 'true' or 'false') Does the actual response match the expected response?

Response: false. the expected response asked for a specific numerical value, while the actual response provided an explanation that no such value was given in the text.

Answer the question based on the above context: what is the total fair value of warrants and rights that are issued and approved by by security holders?

Response:  The total fair value of warrants and rights that are issued and approved by security holders is $35.01. This information can be found in the second column of the table, under the heading "weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants and rights (2)".

Expected Response: 247470105.4
Actual Response:  The total fair value of warrants and rights that are issued and approved by security holders is $35.01. This information can be found in the second column of the table, under the heading "weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants and rights (2)".

(Answer with 'true' or 'false') Does the actual response match the expected response?

Response: false. the actual response provides the weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants, and rights, not the total fair value of those instruments.

is subsequently remeasured based on the achievement of one or more financial and other performance goals . the personnel and compensation committee ( 201cp&cc 201d ) of the board of directors approves the final award payout with respect to certain incentive/performance unit share awards . these awards have either a three-year or a four-year performance period and are payable in either stock or a combination of stock and cash . restricted stock/share unit awards have various vesting periods generally ranging from 3 years to 5 years . beginning in 2013 , we incorporated several enhanced risk- related performance changes to certain long-term incentive compensation programs . in addition to achieving certain financial performance metrics on both an absolute basis and relative to our peers , final payout amounts will be subject to reduction if pnc fails to meet certain risk-related performance metrics as specified in the award agreements . however , the p&cc has the discretion to waive any or all of this reduction under certain circumstances . the weighted-average grant date fair value of incentive/ performance unit share awards and restricted stock/unit awards granted in 2014 ,

Answer the question based on the above context: what was, then, in millions, the total tax of benefit realized from option exercises under all incentive plans for both years, 2013 and 2014 combined?

Response:  The text does not provide the total tax benefit realized from option exercises under all incentive plans for both years, 2013 and 2014 combined. It only mentions the tax benefits in millions for each year separately.

Expected Response: 90
Actual Response:  The text does not provide the total tax benefit realized from option exercises under all incentive plans for both years, 2013 and 2014 combined. It only mentions the tax benefits in millions for each year separately.

(Answer with 'true' or 'false') Does the actual response match the expected response?

Response: false. the actual response explains that the text does not provide the combined tax benefit for both years, while the expected response simply states a numerical value for the combined tax benefit.

Answer the question based on the above context: what is the net difference in gains between the price of advance auto and the price of the s&p index in 2012?

Response:  The net difference in gains between the price of advance auto and the price of the s&p index in 2012 can be calculated as follows: subtract(213.14, const_100), subtract(150.51, const_100), and then subtract the result from the first difference. Therefore, the answer is 62.63.

Expected Response: 55
Actual Response:  The net difference in gains between the price of advance auto and the price of the s&p index in 2012 can be calculated as follows: subtract(213.14, const_100), subtract(150.51, const_100), and then subtract the result from the first difference. Therefore, the answer is 62.63.
---
(Answer with 'true' or 'false') Does the actual response match the expected response?

Response: false. the actual response provides the calculation for finding the net difference between the price of advance auto parts stock and the s&p index in one specific year, but it doesn't actually give the net difference itself as required by the expected response (which is a simple number).

Answer the question based on the above context: what is the total fair value of warrants and rights that are issued and approved by by security holders?

Response:  The total fair value of warrants and rights that are issued and approved by security holders is represented by the number 2956907 multiplied by the weighted-average exercise price of $35.01, as stated in the given context. Therefore, the total fair value would be calculated as follows:

total fair value = number of securities (approved by security holders) × weighted-average exercise price
= 2956907 × $35.01
= $101,541,287

So the answer to the question is: The total fair value of warrants and rights that are issued and approved by security holders is approximately $101,541,287.

Expected Response: 9999999
Actual Response:  The total fair value of warrants and rights that are issued and approved by security holders is represented by the number 2956907 multiplied by the weighted-average exercise price of $35.01, as stated in the given context. Therefore, the total fair value would be calculated as follows:

total fair value = number of securities (approved by security holders) × weighted-average exercise price
= 2956907 × $35.01
= $101,541,287

So the answer to the question is: The total fair value of warrants and rights that are issued and approved by security holders is approximately $101,541,287.
