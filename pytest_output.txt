Answer the question based on the above context: what was, then, in millions, the total tax of benefit realized from option exercises under all incentive plans for both years, 2013 and 2014 combined?

Response:  The text does not provide the total tax benefit in millions realized from option exercises under all incentive plans for both years, 2013 and 2014 combined. It only mentions that the total fair value of incentive/performance unit shares and restricted stock/units awarded vested during 2013 and 2012 was approximately $63 million and $55 million, respectively. The text also mentions that the weighted-average grant date fair value of incentive/performance unit awards and restricted stock/unit awards granted in 2014, 2013, and 2012 was $80.79, $64.77, and $60.68 per share, respectively. However, it does not provide the tax benefit realized from those awards for each year.

Expected Response: 64
Actual Response:  The text does not provide the total tax benefit in millions realized from option exercises under all incentive plans for both years, 2013 and 2014 combined. It only mentions that the total fair value of incentive/performance unit shares and restricted stock/units awarded vested during 2013 and 2012 was approximately $63 million and $55 million, respectively. The text also mentions that the weighted-average grant date fair value of incentive/performance unit awards and restricted stock/unit awards granted in 2014, 2013, and 2012 was $80.79, $64.77, and $60.68 per share, respectively. However, it does not provide the tax benefit realized from those awards for each year.

(Answer with 'true' or 'false') Does the actual response match the expected response?

Response: false. the expected response asked for a specific numerical value, while the actual response provided an explanation that no such value was given in the text.

Answer the question based on the above context: what is the total fair value of warrants and rights that are issued and approved by by security holders?

Response:  The total fair value of warrants and rights that are issued and approved by security holders is $35.01. This information can be found in the second column of the table, under the heading "weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants and rights (2)".

Expected Response: 247470105.4
Actual Response:  The total fair value of warrants and rights that are issued and approved by security holders is $35.01. This information can be found in the second column of the table, under the heading "weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants and rights (2)".

(Answer with 'true' or 'false') Does the actual response match the expected response?

Response: false. the actual response provides the weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants, and rights, not the total fair value of those instruments.
